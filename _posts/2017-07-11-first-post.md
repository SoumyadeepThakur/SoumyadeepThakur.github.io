>&quot;The beginning is the most important part of the work.&quot;

I'm finally done with setting up my blog, but there a lot of stuffs left to be done. Took me a long time to make this site operational.
Summer vacations are over, and I have been working on a couple of projects this summer. Just completed a summer internship in Cryptography under Prof. B.K. Roy at ISI, Kolkata. The other project I am doing is on Frequent Itemset Mining. Hope to make some interesting work out of it. Also trying my hand at learning some foreign languages this summer. That's really cool!
Stay tuned, for more updates!
